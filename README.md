## Introduction

SwiftPay is an API developed to make building digital platforms simpler for developers, while also providing a robust and secure system for end users.

Currently, the API includes the following features:

- User creation and management;

- Transactions via PIX;

- Virtual assistant with a chat system for user support;

- Sandbox environment for transaction testing and integration with external APIs;

- Automatic deletion of inactive users.

SwiftPay is constantly evolving. We are already working on new functionalities that will be added soon, such as:

- [ ] Credit and debit card transactions
- [ ] Creating transactions via virtual assistant
- [ ] Issuing boletos and invoices

## Technologies

Our idea when creating the project was not only to make it practical, but also secure. With that in mind, we used the following technologies:

- Springboot;
- Spring Security;
- Spring AI;
- Spring Data JPA;
- JWT (Json Web Token);
- Mockito/JUnit;
- Docker;
- Swagger;
- AWS (Amazon Web Services).

## Architecture

### üîç What is a monolithic architecture?

Monolithic architecture is a model where the entire application ‚Äî including backend, frontend, business logic, and database integration ‚Äî is centralized in a single application.

### Why the monolithic architecture?

We chose to use monolithic architecture in SwiftPay‚Äôs current phase because it‚Äôs a simpler, more efficient, and appropriate approach for the development stage of the project.

With all components integrated into a single codebase, we were able to speed up development, simplify testing, and maintain a more direct and reliable deployment flow.

## Design Patterns

For this project in particular, we chose to implement the Repository Pattern ‚Äî but why?

First and foremost, this pattern aligns with the SOLID principles, making it both easy to implement and maintain. It provides a clean separation between the data access logic and the business logic of the application.

The main purpose of the Repository Pattern is to abstract the data layer, acting as a mediator between the domain and the data source. This allows us to manage domain objects without needing to know the underlying database implementation, which results in more testable, modular, and flexible code.

## How to run the project

First of all, build your container with this command

```bash

docker build -t swiftpay .

docker run swiftpay

```

Then, navigate to the root of the project via command line and execute the command

```bash

mvn spring-boot:run

```
